<p> Welcome to my website! </p>

<p> I am Benjamin GILBERT, a PhD candidate in Sociology at Sciences Po and Université Paris-Cité. </p>

<p> In my thesis, I am mainly interested in the discourses of justification and legitimization of one's own social position, and in the evolution of these discourses with regard to the critical comments that are made of the concept of merit and more generally of the mechanisms of maintenance and reproduction of socio-economic inequalities. </p>

<p> To conduct this research, I rely on computational machine learning and deep-learning methods, and on data from social networks, the written press, as well as radio and television broadcasts. </p>

<p> Having studied mathematics and computational sciences in the past, I am also interested in research questions related to these disciplines. </p>

<p> I am particularly interested in the theory of large random matrices, methods for mitigating confounding biases in causal inference, the theoretical mathematical foundations of deep learning, as well as all technical and methodological advances in natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). </p>
