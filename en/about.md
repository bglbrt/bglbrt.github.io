<div style=‘text-align: justify’> 

<p> I am currently working in the Civil Service Expertise section at <a href = ‘https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil’>Insee</a>, where I manage a team in charge of producing data and studies on the employment characteristics and wages of civil service employees. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a PhD in sociology at <a href = ‘https://www.sciencespo.fr/fr/’>Sciences Po</a> and <a href = ‘https://u-paris.fr’>Université Paris-Cité</a>. </p>

<p> In my research, I am mainly interested in ordinary categorisations of social space in French traditional media, and how these categorisations have changed since the 1970s. As part of this research, I rely mainly on computational methods of <i>machine</i> and <i>deep learning</i>, and on data from the written press and radio and television broadcasts. </p>

<p> Although these are only very indirectly related to my research subject, I am also interested in research questions in mathematics and computational sciences. In particular, I am interested in the theory of large random matrices, the theoretical foundations of deep learning, and fully homomorphic encryption methods. </p>
