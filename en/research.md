<div style="text-align: justify">

<p> In my research, I try to question how, more than fifty years after the publication in France of The Inheritors (Bourdieu and Passeron, 1964), and as awareness of inequalities and mechanisms of social reproduction increases (Piketty, 2013; Piketty, 2021), educational and political elites manage to justify and legitimise their position in the social space. </p>

<p> In order to study this question, I am therefore interested in turn in the evolutions in the awareness of inequalities and mechanisms of social reproduction, in the discourses of justification and legitimisation of the social ordering, as well as in the views that school and political elites have on their own position within the social stratification? </p>

<p> This research is currently leading me to various projects. Firstly, I am investigating the importance given to themes relating to inequality and social stratification in the media in recent decades, and the semantic shifts in the terms used to characterise social hierarchy using automatic language processing methods. I am also interested in the mobilisation of references to biographical background in political discourses and more generally in the strategies of self-presentation of candidates and elected officials. Finally, I look at discourses criticizing the legitimacy of social position on social networks, using methods of network analysis and modeling, as well as natural language analysis. </p>
